Hello! I am :
 - 📖 a driven postgraduate literature student,
 - 📱 a dedicated senior iPhone/iPad app developer,
 - 📸 an always learning photography enthusiast,
 - ✈️ based in Limoges, France — but I will take any opportunity to travel!

I am currently interested in Swift and SwiftUI 👀, and always learning about these topics 🌱.

When I am not overanalyzing books 🧠🔥, developing apps 🛠, or taking photos 🌆, you will find me exploring the national parks with my dogs 🐕 or learning about otters 🦦.
